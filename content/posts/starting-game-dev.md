# Modifying Existing Games

I started game development around 4-5 years ago creating Minecraft plugins. Modifying an existing game is a great way to get started learning game development because most of the tools are already in place.

If you enjoy any existing games and would like to build off or modify in any way, I definitely recommend it. Games like Roblox are built as easy to use tools to create games but can also be quite powerful. Fortnite is also heading down a similar trend and there are many games that are not too difficult to create mods for as well. 

It is also great if you want to practice game design because you can spend more time thinking about your game since you don’t have to build everything from the ground up.

# Using a Game Engine

If you want more control over your game, then you should learn to use a game engine. It can be intimidating at the beginning, but game engines have never been more accessible. The easiest game engine to learn I’ve found is Godot. It has a simple layout, relatively beginner friendly coding language, and an adorable icon. 

Although it’s good to choose one game engine, it’s also good to try out a couple and see what you like. Do some research and see the pros and cons of each engine. One thing that could help reassure you is that most game engines are fairly similar, so if you learn one game engine and eventually want or have to switch then it usually isn’t too difficult. This is what I did when I switched from Unity to Godot.

## How I would Learn a Game Engine

Once you have chosen a game engine, it’s time to create some cool games! The formula that I follow and recommend when learning a game engine is as follows: Do a little research, practice, and repeat. I have found it to be a simple, yet effective model.

First, follow along (not just watch) tutorials of the very very basics. Don’t overload yourself with information. Mess around with the things you learn and experiment. There is a lot of information at first but don’t be overwhelmed. Try to get comfortable with the layout and the most important features.

Once you understand the fundamentals, try creating a simple game that already exists. My go to is flappy bird, but you can choose any simple game. If you haven’t already, break that game down into its components. For flappy bird, this could mean:

1. Being able to move an object up with a force (The bird flapping)
2. Include gravity (For the bird to fall)
3. Have objects that spawn in (The pipes)
4. Have either the bird move to the right (or pipes move to the left!)
5. Restart the game when there is a collision (When the bird hits the pipes)

Now this isn’t the entire game of flappy bird, but it contains the most important and fundamental components. There are elements like the menu, score, art, and much more that you can add on, but none of these elements are necessary. 

Feel free to use online resources if you get stuck (I know I did when I started), but it’s important to not just copy code down. Try your best to understand what is happening so you can do it on your own next time. It’s important to find a balance between copying someone else's work all the time and never searching anything up. 

My rule of thumb is that if I don’t understand what someone is doing I try to do more research to understand it or I use an alternative method.

After recreating a simple game like this I would recreate another! Try to find a game with some similar core elements like spawning in objects and moving them around, but that also includes some new elements like learning to use a tile map or something.

Once you feel comfortable with the core elements you can either recreate another game or the fun part, make your own game! I’m not going to explain how to come up with a game idea, but try to use parts of games you already like. Try to keep the game simple, but just because it’s simple doesn’t mean it can’t be cool or fun! For me, the first simple, yet enjoyable game that comes to mind is crossy road. 

To learn godot I followed this same process. I recreated Flappy Bird and then created my own game about a frog eating apples. It wasn’t anything revolutionary but it gave me a solid foundation on all the core elements.

After you create your own, unique, simple game, just keep making projects with added complexity. Try not to take too big of leaps, but make your projects more complex, learn to work with a team, and bring your visions to life! Another piece of advice is try to keep your game ideas as simple as you can. If you have an idea that could work in 2D or 3D, make it in 2D, you’ll thank yourself later.

## My Mistakes When I Started

I started with way too much complexity. I remember early on I was trying to create first person FPS with multiplayer which is absolutely insane to think about it. I love multiplayer FPS games so that’s all I wanted to create. I also watched videos online and they made it look easy (but they also had a lot more time and practice). 

The good thing was that I was excited about it, which I’m glad, but I wish I found a simpler game type to be excited about. I still learned many of the core skills, but at a slower pace because it was convoluted with all the complex parts of networks, 3d models, and advanced coding concepts.

# Conclusion

It’s hard to know the best way to learn something because once you’ve learned it, you have a different perspective. However, I still stand by this method of learning the fundamentals, practicing, and repeating. I’ve heard similar advice from other people as well. The most important thing is practice. With enough time and effort you can learn anything so even if you don’t go down the ‘perfect’ path of learning game development, you will get there in the end. Thanks for reading.
