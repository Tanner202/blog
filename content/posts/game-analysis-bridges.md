# New Series
In this blog post I'm starting a new series where I analyze games! I'm going to be breaking these games down into their components. Dissecting what makes them fun and what parts could be improved. These games are going to be anything ranging from board games to video games. In each post of this series I will first give a reason for analyzing the game, a brief description, some of the mechanics, and then my thoughts on what made it fun and finally the problems and potential solutions. All of these are my interpretations so don't take any of these as facts, but I hope you can either be inspired by these games or use some of what they did well in your own games. If you have a game you want me to analyze please contact me on my contact page and I will try to add it to the list. Anyways that's enough info on the series so let's get into it!

# Intro
In this first post of this series I will be analyzing a minigame called **The Bridges** that was on a minecraft multiplayer server called Mineplex. It’s very niche, but bear with me because this game was well designed and has a lot to offer. The reason I’m analyzing this game is because I really enjoyed it as a kid. I'm hoping to find out what made it so enticing for me and what could've made it even better.

## Description of Game
In this game, there were four teams of ten. Each team was placed onto their own floating island. Everyone would then spend around ten minutes collecting resources to prepare for battle. After this time, bridges would form between the islands, allowing the teams to fight. Besides allowing teams to fight, a bridge was also formed to a center island which contained more loot. Each player had their own kit and the last team standing won. Overall the rules of the game were simple, but it still had depth in strategy in skill which makes for a great game!

## Dissecting what Made it Fun
When I played this game I wasn't very good at combat against other players (also known as PVP). I would usually mine for ten minutes, try to go fight, and then die. The part that was most interesting for me was the mining. This kind of surprises me because I think mining is one of the most boring mechanics in Minecraft. It takes so much time and there isn't really any skill or anything fun about it. The reason mining in *The Bridges* was more enjoyable for me was because I was more likely to find resources faster. This was because more resources were held within a smaller area. Despite having an abundance of resources, it wasn’t a big problem because players only had ten minutes to collect them. This made it exciting because while players wouldn't find resources all of the time, they always knew that they were close by.

The excitement of finding resources was further enhanced by kits like the miner and bomber. The miner kit pointed you in the direction of the ore your pickaxe was made out of every certain amount of seconds. This worked well because as a player, once I found enough diamonds to make a pickaxe, I thought I was rich, since technically I could infinitely search for diamonds. However, usually by this time the mining was either almost up or most of the diamonds were gone. Making the player feel overpowered even when they aren’t is gold in game design. I've seen other games do this in waves where when the player unlocks new equipment they will be able to easily defeat monsters. Then they move onto the next stage and the difficulty increases. It may sound cruel because it's like hanging a piece of meat in front of a dog, but I think it's fine if the player is having fun. This ebb and flow also helps create moments of joy and excitement which is good. I know some board games like Ascension Tactics make the player feel overpowered at the very end of the game. This leaves the player wanting to play again in hopes of becoming overpowered again. Anyways, back to *The Bridges* gamemode, I loved the aspect of feeling overpowered even when I wasn't. This feeling was enhanced by the other kit I mentioned earlier which was the bomber kit. The bomber kit allowed the player to blow up resources their pickaxe couldn’t mine. This added some decision making of whether the player wanted the early game rewards by blowing up diamonds that were easy to find using the bomber kit or the late game reward of tracking diamonds deep within the island using the miner kit.

Luckily, my 10 year old self was smart enough to figure out that I could invite a friend and we could have both of the kits. This strategy of coalescing both kits allowed for us to achieve more than we ever could on our own. In addition, it added a layer of fun because we would constantly be communicating about the game. As an example, I would choose the miner kit while my friend would choose the bomber kit. When we loaded into the game one of us would instantly rush down into the cave to get any iron we could. While one of us was doing that, the other would gather wood on the surface to get ready to craft sticks for the pickaxes. In the end we were able to quickly make a diamond pickaxe and find more diamonds nearby using the miner kit. This strategy worked pretty well and added some depth to an otherwise simple game. 

This brings me to something else which is the idea of allowing the players to have different goals. I think it’s hard to be able to do this because you need a decent amount of content to allow this but luckily this game had just enough. While most people were just trying to defeat all the other teams like normal people, my friend and I wanted to get as many diamonds as possible, in hopes of obtaining full diamond armor.

Last but not least I have to acknowledge that nostalgia played a factor in remembering how fun this game was for me. It slightly distorts my view of the gamemode, but I tried my best to extract what made it fun from the experience so that others who may not have had these experiences can see the game design decisions made on this game.

## Summary of Elements that Made it Fun
1. Chasing a sub-goal
Me and my friends' goal was to craft the best gear in the game. We knew we weren't the best at PvP and we didn't want to be. We had an alternative goal and the fact that we were able to pursue that helped make the gamemode more enjoyable for us. This is why we chose this gamemode over a pure combat gamemode. The combat helped us get a good metric of how we did when collecting resources, but it wasn't our focus.

2. Feeling overpowered
We only chased this sub-goal because we believed it was possible. We felt that it was within reach AND that it was worth achieving. This achievement is feeling overpowered which is what most players want.

3. Teamwork
Friends almost always make a game more fun. We chose this game because it gave us something to talk about. We talked about what kits to select, where to go, who had what materials, and how much time we had left. It was exhilarating to have so much going on which brings me to my next point.

4. Time Limit
The time limit helped give us a sense of urgency. If we had infinite time it wouldn't have been any fun. There wouldn't have been any chance to fail. The time limit gave us a clear indication of success or failure. If we got diamond gear before the time limit, we succeeded, and if we got it after then we failed. This also gave us more incentive to work as a team because if we didn't our chances of getting full diamond gear would go down.

5. Strategy
The goal wasn't enough to drive us to play again. It was the idea that we could play differently in order to reach greater success. This trial and error was a pillarstone in us believing we had a chance. We saw how the kits we selected gave us a certain chance. We saw how our communication of who would get what materials. As an example, one person with a default pickaxe would start mining for iron while the other would grab wood to craft sticks for an iron pickaxe. Small things like this that helped speed up our process to beat the clock (and our teammates) and helped encourage us to try again.

6. Skill
Although mining didn't have as much skill as combat. We felt that we were practicing our craft and getting better at being efficient. This was helpful for getting us to play again and again. Hoping that our different strategies and practice would be enough to achieve our goal.

## The Problems and Possible Solutions

Unbalanced Fights
Another problem unrelated to mining is that a lot of time teammates would leave or die early on in the game. This would make the game feel pointless because the chances of winning a three versus ten isn't very likely.

A small feature that would help solve this problem is an ability to team up with another team if your teams were under a certain size. This would make the game less fair, but more fun. As an example a 2 vs 3 vs 9 could turn into a 5vs9 which gives the smaller teams a little bit of a chance. This would just make the game more interesting for a longer period of time.

In-team Fighting
A lot of times during the mining phase teammates would race to get the resources before one another. Some may view this as not a problem, but I think the frustration of having your resources stolen could be reduced.

The easiest ways to fix this would be to make more mine shafts so the players disperse more and make it so the player who mines the resources is guaranteed to receive them.

Large Size of Gamemode
This gamemode required around 40 people per game which was a lot. This was mainly a problem in the later days of the gamemode when there were less players and the time to get into a game increased

This problem could be solved fairly easily by just making each team smaller. It is easier said than done, but most parts of the gamemode seem scalable. Updates would need to be made to the maps, but besides that the game would function fairly similarly.

# Conclusion
Overall, this gamemode was fairly enjoyable. If it got more updates to change the strategy around and maybe reduced the team size to keep queue times fast I think it could have stuck around a little longer. I hope you enjoyed reading this article and I hope you learned more about this game and the game design elements that made it fun.
